for visually impaired people.  

----

==Pre-requisites==
1. Android SDK starter package
2. Android Plugin for Eclipse - Android emulator for testing the code.

==Technical Overview==

1. Acquire image from phone + write to buffer<br/>
2. Phone client process + server process<br/>
3. Classification of image data + rescale image<br/>
4. Output text to audio<br/>
5. Deploy java program to Android<br/>
<br/>

====Acquire image from phone + write to buffer====
This is the starting phase of the program.

====Output text to audio====
Once the server determines the denomination of the bill, the next thing to do is to convert the result into audible files.<br/>
Currently, we create actual audio files for each denomination of bills. This means that once the server finishes recognizing<br/>
the denomination, it will then select the corresponding audio file and play it to the user.
