=Mobile Currency Reader=
<br/>


==Overview==

This mobile currency reader project intends to make tasks such as recognizing the values of different dollar bills easier for visually impaired people. The application will first prompt users to capture an image of the holding bill, and the captured image will be transferred to the server. Then the server will process the image in order to recognize the value of the bill. Once the value of the bill is determined, the server will select the appropriate audio file to play to the users.

==Pre-requisites==
1. Android SDK starter package<br/>
2. Android Plugin for Eclipse - Android emulator for testing the code.

==Technical Overview==

1. Acquire image from phone + write to buffer<br/>
2. Phone client process + server process<br/>
3. Classification of image data + rescale image<br/>
4. Output text to audio<br/>
5. Deploy java program to Android<br/>
<br/>

====Acquiring Image from Phone and Writing to Buffer====
The first step in the application is to acquire image of the bill. For our prototype,
the user interface is fairly straight-forward - allowing the user to take a snap shot of a 
Dollar bank note. At first, we simply downloaded the code for a simple Camera Demo off
the internet. We soon encountered the problem that we did not know what the simulator is
taking a photo of, since the simulator does not use the web cam as the actual camera of an
android phone. Once the user takes the picture, the Java application turns the image into
a byte array.

====Output text to audio====
Once the server determines the denomination of the bill, the next thing to do is to convert the result into audible files.<br/>
Currently, we create actual audio files for each denomination of bills. This means that once the server finishes recognizing<br/>
the denomination, it will then select the corresponding audio file and play it to the user.

==Future Improvement==

1. Currently, it is built primarily for Android users. In the future, it can be modified to adapt with different mobile platforms.
